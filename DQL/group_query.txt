语法：
    SELECT column, group_function(column)
    FROM table
    [WHERE condition]
    [GROUP BY group_by_expression]
    [ORDER BY column];

SELECT MAX(salary), job_id
FROM employees
GROUP BY job_id; #查询每个工种的最高工资

添加筛选条件（分组前筛选）：
    SELECT AVG(salary), department_id
    FROM employees
    WHERE email LIKE '%a%'
    GROUP BY department_id;

添加复杂的筛选条件（分组后筛选）：
    SELECT COUNT(*), departmen_id
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY deparment_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 2;

按表达式/函数筛选：
    SELECT COUNT(*), LENGTH(last_name) last_name
    FROM employees
    GGROUP BY LENGTH(last_name)
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;

按多个字段查询：
    SELECT AVG(salary), deparment_id, job_id
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department_id, job_id

添加排序：
    SELECT AVG(salary), department_id
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY job_id, deparment_id
    ORDER BY AVG(salary) DESC;
